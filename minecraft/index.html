    <h1>BASIC MODPACK SET-UP</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a Minecraft launcher that supports modpack installation. I use <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism</a>, but you can use <a href="https://atlauncher.com/">ATLauncher</a>, <a href="https://gdlauncher.com/">GDLauncher</a> or <a href="https://multimc.org/">MultiMC</a> (don't use  Overwolf, it's bloated with ads and has a bad reputation handling user data and security).</li>
        <li>Download Create: Astral v2.0.5b (the most currently up-to-date version as of 1st Feb 2024) <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-astral/files/4729689">here</a>. DON'T unzip it.</li>
        <li>Create a new instance in your Minecraft launcher of choice, then select 'Import from zip'. Select the zip file with Create: Astral.</li>
        <li>Launch it. You will likely be prompted to register your login details with your launcher of choice. Do that, and continue.</li>
        <li>OPTIONAL: You might be prompted to locate a Java installation. You will want to use Java 17, so if you don't have it, go get it <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17">here</a>, install it, then select it in your launcher after.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You now have Create: Astral set up!</p>
    <br>
    <h1>SERVER DETAILS</h1>
    <p>The server domain is: <span>mc.seraph.network</span></p>
    <p>You can view a live map of the server and interact with the server chat on your browser here: <a href="https://map.seraph.network">map.seraph.network</a></p>
    <p>The server is currently hosted in Virginia, i.e. US EAST</p>
    <br>
    <h1>TIPS ON GETTING STARTED</h1>
    <p>Create: Astral makes use of FTB Quests to guide you through progressing the pack. The default key to open the FTB Quests GUI is 'j'. Click on a quest to see advice on what to do next, as well as completion requirements and rewards.</p>
    <p>If you're playing with other people and want to progress as a group, you can use FTB Teams to make a team. You can bind a key to the GUI, but sometimes the GUI doesn't work, instead you can use the command /team to manage your team.</p>
    <p>Create: Astral unifies all tech progression to Tech Reborn and Create, as well as using other supplementry mods such as Farmer's Delight. It is encouraged that you seek out relevant information for either yourself, however Create has its own in-game tutorials via the 'Ponder' keyword (click on the goggles icon in the menu and click 'Ponder Index' to see all tutorials in this manner).</p>
    <p>If you're handy with a skin editor, Create: Astral also comes with the Ears mod, which allows you to add details to your skins such as ears, tails, snouts and more. Check <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ears">here</a> for more information with customising that.</p>

    <h1>TROUBLESHOOTING</h1>
    <h2>Server says 'Old' or 'Paper X.XX' and won't let me connect!</h2>
    <p>Your client or modpack is on the wrong version of Minecraft. Make sure you're on Minecraft version 1.18.2 with Create: Astral v2.0.5b.</p>
    <h2>I keep randomly stopping while flying!</h2>
    <p>You are moving too fast for the server to load chunks, and the server is set to not allow players to enter unloaded chunks. This was set for optimisation reasons, but I don't mind turning it off if it becomes an issue, so just let me know.</p>
    <h2>I can't visit the Nether!</h2>
    <p>Yup! There is no Nether in Create: Astral, all of the resources you can acquire via the Nether are distributed around the world or... on other worlds?</p>
    <h2>Can't find/connect to server!</h2>
    <p>This can be a number of issues. DM me on Discord at 'photonicDog' and I'll try and help.</p>
