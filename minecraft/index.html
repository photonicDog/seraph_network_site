    <h1>BASIC MODPACK SET-UP</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Get a Minecraft launcher that supports modpack installation. I use <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism</a>, but you can use <a href="https://atlauncher.com/">ATLauncher</a>, <a href="https://gdlauncher.com/">GDLauncher</a> or <a href="https://multimc.org/">MultiMC</a> (don't use  Overwolf, it's bloated with ads and has a bad reputation handling user data and security).</li>
        <li>Download Create: Astral v2.0.5b (the most currently up-to-date version as of 1st Feb 2024) <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-astral/files/4729689">here</a>. DON'T unzip it.</li>
        <li>Create a new instance in your Minecraft launcher of choice, then select 'Import from zip'. Select the zip file with Create: Astral.</li>
        <li>Launch it. You will likely be prompted to register your login details with your launcher of choice. Do that, and continue.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You now have Create: Astral set up!</p>
    <br>
    <h1>SERVER DETAILS</h1>
    <p>The server domain is: <span>mc.seraph.network</span></p>
    <p>You can view a live map of the server on your browser here: <a href="https://map.seraph.network">map.seraph.network</a></p>
    <p>The server is currently hosted in Virginia, i.e. US EAST</p>
    <br>
    <h1>TROUBLESHOOTING</h1>
    <h2>Server says 'Old' or 'Paper X.XX' and won't let me connect!</h2>
    <p>Your client or modpack is on the wrong version of Minecraft. Make sure you're on Minecraft version 1.18.2 with Create: Astral v2.0.5b.</p>
    <h2>Can't find/connect to server!</h2>
    <p>This can be a number of issues. DM me on Discord at 'photonicDog' and I'll try and help.</p>
